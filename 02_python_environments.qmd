title: "Python Virtual Environments and Package Management"
---

# Introduction

The next useful topic that you will need to know is how to manage Python
virtual environments and manage package dependencies.

We're going to build upon our [Command Shells](01_command_shells.qmd) skills
to install Python and manage virtual environments.

We also assume that you have a basic understanding of Python. If you need a
tutorial, check out the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).

The great thing about Python is that it is a very popular language for scientific
computing and so there are a lot of great libraries and tools that you can use.

This can also be a challenge because every python project will have different
package dependencies, and even dependencies on specific versions of packages.

The solution to this problem is to use virtual environments.

There are basically two categories of environments and package managers:

1. `conda`
2. `venv` and `pip`

## Conda

First a little clarification is in order since you'll hear the terms "conda",
"miniconda", and "anaconda" thrown around.

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is an open source package, dependency,
and environment management system that can manage packages for multiple languages
but is primarily used for Python.

_Anaconda_ is a distribution of conda that includes _a lot_ of packages bundled
together. It is maintained by [Anaconda, Inc](https://www.anaconda.com/). We
don't recommend using it because it is a large download and includes a lot of
packages that you may not need.

Miniconda is a minimal installation of conda, maintained by [Anaconda, Inc](https://www.anaconda.com/).
With miniconda you can install only the packages you need.

Anaconda maintians a [repository](https://anaconda.org/) of packages that you
can install with the `conda install` command.  It sometimes happens that a package
is not available in the conda repository, but is available in the PyPI repository
which we discuss below.

To recap, conda is a tool for both package and environment management and we
recommend using miniconda to tailor the installation to your needs.


## venv and pip

The `venv` module is a standard library that is included with Python that supports
creating python virtual environments.

`pip` is a package manager that is usually included with a Python installation.
It is the recommended way by the
[Python Packaging Authority](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/) to install Python
packages. It installs packages from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)
(PyPI) which tends to be a more comprehensive repository of Python packages than
the conda repository.

# Python Versioning and Upgrading


## `pip` vs `python3 -m pip`

A word of caution here when you have multiple versions of Python installed.
The commands `python`, `python3` and `pip` may be associated with different
versions of python.

A good habit is to check locations and versions of these commands with:

```bash
which python
python --version

which python3
python3 --version

which pip
pip --version
```

On MacOS, I get

```bash
% which python
python not found

% which python3
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/python3
% python3 --version
Python 3.12.4

% which pip
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/pip
% pip --version
pip 24.2 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip (python 3.12)

% which pip3
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/pip3
% pip3 --version
pip 24.2 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip (python 3.12)
```

It used to be on previous versions of MacOS it would come with Python 2.x as
default as `python`, and `pip` would be the Python 2.x package manager. Now, you
see that in the system installation, there is no `python`, and `pip` is actually an
alias to `pip3`. 

From the location and version shown above, we can see that `pip`, `pip3`, and `python3`
are all associated with the same version, in this case Python 3.12.4.

> Note that in both conda and venv, both `pip` and `python` are aliases to the
> `pip3` and `python3`.

`pip` is actually just a command line wrapper around the `pip` module`, so a
good precaution is to use `python3 -m pip` to install packages.
The command `python3 -m pip` is always associated with the version of Python that
you are currently using.

## Installing and Upgrading Python

It's very likely there is a newer version of Python available than is installed
by default or was previously installed. The way you install Python depends on
your operating system and command shell.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### MacOS

There are multiple ways to install. 

#### Using python.org

Probably the easiest way is to download and install the MacOS install package from
[python.org downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This method allows you to install
the latest version directly from the Python Software Foundation.

::: {.callout-caution}
The installation from python.org will likely leave your old installation of Python
and install another version in a different location.
:::

#### Using Homebrew

Alternatively, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install and manage Python versions:

1. Install Homebrew if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Install Python:
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```

3. To update Python using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew update              # Update Homebrew itself
   brew upgrade python      # Upgrade Python to the latest version
   ```

4. Verify the installed version:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

::: {.callout-note}
Homebrew might not always have the absolute latest version available on python.org,
but it provides an easy way to manage and update Python along with other packages.
:::


### Windows Subystem for Linux (WSL)

On WSL Ubuntu, you can install Python from the package manager.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

To see all available versions, you can use the `apt list` command.

```
apt list python3 -a
```

If there is a newer version available, you can upgrade Python by following these steps:

1. Update your package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Check the latest version available through apt:
   ```bash
   apt list python3 -a
   ```

3. If a newer version is available, upgrade Python:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install --only-upgrade python3
   ```

4. Verify the new version:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

5. If you need a specific newer version not available in the default repositories, you can use a PPA:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3.x  # Replace x with the desired version number
   ```

Note: Using a PPA allows you to install versions of Python that may not be available in the standard Ubuntu repositories.

:::

There are cases where you might end up with multiple versions of python installed
simultaneously, which is fine, but just know that on both MacOS command shells and
WSL Ubuntu, the first python executable found in the search path will be the one
executed and the one shown from `which python3`.

## Conda Installation

As mentioned above, we generally prefer the miniconda distribution of `conda`.
You can find installation instructions at
[https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

It describes both the
[GUI](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#latest-miniconda-installer-links) and
the [command line](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install)
installation methods.

::: {.callout-tip}
Remember that for WSL Ubuntu, you'll need use the command line installation
method.
:::

## Conda Environment

Next step is to create a conda environment.
See [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/working-with-conda/environments/)
for complete instructions.

```bash
conda create -n my_test_env

conda activate my_test_env
```

To see what packages are installed in the environment, you can use the `conda list` command.

```bash
conda list
```
::: {.callout}
What do you see in the list?
:::

To deactivate the environment, you can use the `conda deactivate` command.

```bash
conda deactivate
```

To remove the environment, you can use:

```bash
conda remove -n my_test_env --all
```

Now let's create a new environment with python 3.12.4 and see what packages are installed.

```bash
conda create -n my_test_env python=3.12.4
```
Now you can activate the environment and see what packages are installed.

```bash
conda activate my_test_env

conda list
```

::: {.callout}
How many packages do you see in the list?
:::

## Installing Packages

To install a package such as `jupyter`, you can use the `conda install` command.

```bash
conda install jupyter
```

You can also install a specific version of a package or major version of a package.

```bash
conda install jupyter=1.0.0

# install the latest minor version of the major version 1
conda install jupyter=1
```

To list the available versions of packages to install from conda, you can use the `conda search` command. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
conda search package_name
```

For example, if you want to see all available versions of the `jupyter` package, you would run:

```bash
conda search jupyter
```

This will show you a list of all available versions of the package, along with information about which channel they're from and which platforms they support.

If you want to see versions for a specific channel, you can use the `--channel` or `-c` option:

```bash
conda search --channel conda-forge jupyter
```

To see more details about a package, including its dependencies, you can use the `--info` flag:

```bash
conda search --info jupyter
```

If you want to see all packages that match a certain pattern, you can use wildcards:

```bash
conda search 'python=3.8*'
```

This would show all versions of Python 3.8.x available.

Remember, the available versions may depend on your current conda configuration, including which channels you have enabled. You might want to update your conda first to ensure you're seeing the most recent information:

```bash
# make sure you are not in a conda environment
conda deactivate

conda update conda
```

These commands will help you find the specific versions of packages available for installation through conda.

## Updating Packages

To check for updates and then update packages in a specific conda environment, you can follow these steps:

1. First, activate the environment you want to check:

```bash
conda activate my_test_env
```

2. To check for updates without actually installing them:

```bash
conda update --all --dry-run
```

This command will show you what packages would be updated without actually performing the update.

3. If you're satisfied with the proposed updates, you can perform the actual update:

```bash
conda update --all
```

This will update all packages in the current environment to their latest compatible versions.

::: {.callout-tip}
You can also update specific packages by naming them:

```bash
conda update package1 package2
```
:::


::: {.callout-note}
Remember that conda will only update to versions that are compatible with other packages in your environment. Sometimes, major version updates might require manually specifying the new version or recreating the environment.
:::


By regularly checking for and applying updates, you can ensure your environment has the latest features and security patches.

## conda environment.yml

It's often a good idea to make it easy for others 
to recreate your environment. You can do this by creating a `environment.yml` file.

```bash
conda env export > environment.yml
```

Then to create an environment from the `environment.yml` file, you can use the `conda env create` command.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Note that this will create a new environment with the same packages as the current environment and 
also the same name of the environment.

You can see which environments are available with the `conda env list` command.

Here's a handy [conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)


## venv and pip

### Creating a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment using venv, you can use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv my_test_env
```

This creates a new virtual environment named `my_test_env` in the current directory.

### Activating the Environment

To activate the environment:

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### MacOS/Linux
```bash
source my_test_env/bin/activate
```

#### Windows
```bash
my_test_env\Scripts\activate
```

:::

When activated, your command prompt should change to indicate the active environment.

### Deactivating the Environment

To deactivate the environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

### Installing Packages

To install a package such as `jupyter`, you can use the `pip install` command:

```bash
python -m pip install jupyter
```

You can also install a specific version of a package:

```bash
python -m pip install jupyter==1.0.0

# install the latest minor version of the major version 1
python -m pip install jupyter~=1.0.0
```

### Listing Installed Packages

To see what packages are installed in the environment:

```bash
pip list
```

### Checking for Package Updates

To check for updates to installed packages:

```bash
pip list --outdated
```

### Updating Packages

To update a specific package:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade package_name
```

To update all packages:

```bash
pip list --outdated | cut -d ' ' -f1 | xargs -n1 pip install -U
```

### Creating Requirements File

To create a `requirements.txt` file listing all installed packages:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Installing from Requirements File

To install packages from a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Removing the Environment

To remove the virtual environment, simply delete the environment folder:

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### MacOS/Linux
```bash
rm -rf my_test_env
```

#### Windows
```bash
rmdir /s /q my_test_env
```

:::

Remember to deactivate the environment before removing it.

::: {.callout-tip}
Always use `python -m pip` instead of just `pip` to ensure you're using the correct version of pip associated with your current Python environment.
:::

## A word on package caching

Note that `pip` and `conda` will cache packages, often in your home directory.
This could be a problem because, for exeample, different versions if the same
program can be cached where you limite resources.
